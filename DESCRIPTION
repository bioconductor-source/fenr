Description: Perform fast functional enrichment on feature lists (like genes
    or proteins) using the hypergeometric distribution. Tailored for speed,
    this package is ideal for interactive platforms such as Shiny. It supports
    the retrieval of functional data from sources like GO, KEGG, Reactome,
    and WikiPathways. By downloading and preparing data first, it allows for
    rapid successive tests on various feature selections without the need
    for repetitive, time-consuming preparatory steps typical of other packages.
