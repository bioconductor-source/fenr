## Version 0.1.11 (2022-10-11)
 
 - Significant speed-up of enrichment by using Rfast::Hash in place of R lists
 - KEGG improvements, recognizing flat file genes with no gene synonym
 - Additional tests for Reactome
 - Minor improvements and fixes

## Version 0.1.13
 
- Added functions `get_term_features` and `get_feature_terms` to access data safely
- HACK: BioPlanet server's SSL certificate expired, so need insecure download.

## Version 0.1.14 (2023-02-02)

- Ditched large and clunky `Rfast` and using native R environments as fast hashes (see https://riptutorial.com/r/example/18339/environments-as-hash-maps)
- A few tweaks and improvements

## Version 0.1.15 (2023-03-02)

- Fixed a bug where there are some features at a term that are not present in the universe (all features). This could happen when the universe was particularly small. Potentially a serious bug.

## Version 0.1.16 (2023-03-16)

- Added a fix to work correctly with integer feature IDs.


## Version 0.1.17 (2023-04-18)

 - New units tests added

## Version 0.99.0 (2023-04-20)

 - Pre-release Bioconductor version.

## Version 0.99.1 (2023-04-25)

 - BioPlanet database vanished from internet and there is no sign of it coming back. Removing all BioPlanet-related code and replacing BioPlanet with GO in the vignette and examples (this, alas, makes it longer to check).
 - OK, it is back, but I keep GO examples and vignettes.
 - Minor improvements to documentation.
 
## Version 0.99.2 (2023-05-24)
 
 - BioPlanet's tripod.nih.gov SSL certificate seems to be fixed, so reversing to the original read_csv code.
 
## Version 0.99.3
 
 - Continuing issues with access to BioPlanet. `fetch_bp` example is now marked `donotrun` and testing `fetch_bp` is removed to ensure smooth build and check even when BioPlanet server is down.
 
## Version 0.99.4
 
 - Taking `BiocCheck` new warnings into account: adding `@return` to data roxygens.
 
## Version 0.99.5

 - Major overhaul following comments from Bioconductor's reviewer.

## Version 0.99.6

### In response to reviewer's comments

 - The wording in the vignette was adjusted to more clearly convey the purpose of the package to users
 - Rewritten the description in DESCRIPTION file to clearly convey the purpose of the package to users
 
### BioPlanet seems defunct 
 
 - Removed BioPlanet for good, as their webpage is continuously down and the maintainer is not responding

### Minor adjustments to speed up building and testing

 - Removed KEGG from interactive example to speed up vignette building (GO and Reactome are sufficient for a simple example)
 - Replaced yeast with simpler organisms in Wiki and KEGG tests to speed up testing
 - Replaced yeast with simpler organisms in Wiki and KEGG examples to speed up checking
 
## Version 0.99.7

 - Minor changes to prepare for Bioconductor release
 - Reverting temporarily to *readr* version 1 to circumvent a *vroom* 1.6.4 bug

## Version 1.0.1

 - First update after Bioconductor release
 - Implemented changes to prevent the package from build/check fail, if one of the remote servers is not responding
 - Moved from `httr` to `httr2` 
 - Tests and examples now generate warnings in case of server failure
 - Added tests for behaviour in case of a non-responsive server
 - Extended test coverage to 100%, except for the interactive example
 
## Version 1.0.2

 - Bug fixes, examples need on_error = "warn"

## Version 1.0.4

 - Reinstated Bioplanet access, this time with graceful fail when the website is down.
 - Minor code changes.
 
## Version 1.0.5

 - Bug fix: if feature id - term id mapping is not unique (which can happen), features are duplicated in counting; fixed by `dplyr::distinct()` on mapping
 - Correction in vignette: using yeast genome for `topGO`, instead of human.
 - Improving test coverage

## Version 1.0.6

 - Changed the Ensembl mapping file downloaded from Reactome to "Physical entity" mapping, as it contains gene symbols, in addition to the Ensembl IDs.
 - Changed the name of GAF column `DB Object Synonym` from `gene_synonym` to `gene_id` for consistency with other methods.
 - Corrected Reactome test as it failed with multiple gene symbols per gene id.
 - Replaced biomaRt with a single RESTful XML call; as biomaRt is used only once to obtain GO terms, this replacement reduced dependency footprint of the package

## Version 1.0.7

 - Improved error handling with unresponsive servers - timeouts are now handled gracefully

## Version 1.0.8

 - Further improving error handling, making sure `assert_url_path()` handles timeouts properly
 - Introduced on_error = "ignore" for test purposes
 
## Version 1.0.9

 - Changed the way `assert_url_path()` handles some remote files - it turns out every time it was called, the entire file was unnecessary downloaded, leading to duplication. Now we only assert top directories. Should speed things up!
 - Increased default timeout to 30 s.

## Version 1.0.10

 - Due to recurring issues with build and check on Bioconductor's machines, I have removed all database downloads from the vignette. Any glitch in the GO server, or simply an internet problem would cause the vignette build to crash. The GO-term information is now attached as data and loaded in the vignette.
 - Made sure the package passes BUILD and CHECK with no internet connection.
 - Correction in vignette: using yeast genome for `topGO`, instead of human (somehow it was not applied in 1.0.5).

## Version 1.2.1

 - Go term namespace added to the information extracted by `fetch_go`.
